I'm taking just about every available MOOC on data science subjects. In addition, a mentor at work is teaching Applied Predictive Modeling during a lunch and learn series. I need a way to begin "writing it down to remember now." With that I'm taking notes and making them available. The current series will enhance my data programming with python. I've been using R for about 2 years but only side projects in python. I actually like ipython notebooks and how prevalent they are as I don't see as many examples like that in RMarkdown files out there. 


Here's my first one based on the second lab in Harvard's CS109 Data Science class.

I can't wait for Tableau to release Tableau for Mac this quarter!!! This viz would look so much better pulled into tableau public and hosted on the web with more viz types. I'll update this notebook when that's availalbe.
