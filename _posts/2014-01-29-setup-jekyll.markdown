I wanted a way to begin publishing information on data science, visualization, and other interesting analytics work I come across. I found out about using github to host <a href=http://www.jekyllrb.org>Jekyll</a> pages by reading this post on <a href=http://lucafoschini.com/2014/01/15/blogging-like-a-data-hacker.html target=_blank>blogging like a [data] hacker</a>. I've always wanted to host a website about data and github pages is the best solution.

So here it is! After a few hours of hacking around ruby and Jekyll I have this site live. 

I intend to use it as a portfolio and a conversation starter, but first and foremost as a way to get work into a single stream of posts. 

I look forward to applying a new template and some more interesting layouts in the near future.
